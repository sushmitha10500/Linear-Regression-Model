#Algorithm for Linear Regression in Python:
Import Libraries: Load necessary libraries for data manipulation and model building.
Load Dataset: Use a small publicly available dataset (e.g., housing prices or student scores).
Split the Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Build the Model: Use the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn.
Train the Model: Fit the model on the training data.
Evaluate the Model: Calculate metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score on the test data.
Visualize Results: Optionally, plot the regression line and test data points.
