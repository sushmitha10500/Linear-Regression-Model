# Linear-Regression-Model
# Build the model using Python’s scikit-learn library. Evaluate the model’s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). 
# Regression: It is a Supervised Learning Technique used to predict a Continuous Numerical Values based on relationship b/w input features(independent variables) and the target variables(dependent). It models the pattern in the data to make predictions about unseen data points.
# Linear Regression: It is one of the type in regression, which gives the linear relationship b/w the input variables(x-axis) and target variables(y-axis).
